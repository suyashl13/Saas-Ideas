### Used Products Resale Platform for Necessary Yet Infrequently Used Items

### **1. The Problem**
Many people purchase items that are necessary but only used occasionally, such as power tools, party supplies, seasonal equipment, or specialized kitchen gadgets. These items often end up unused for most of the year, taking up space and depreciating in value.

Key issues:
- Owners struggle to find platforms specifically for reselling such items.
- Buyers prefer affordable, pre-owned options but lack trusted sources.
- Existing platforms like OLX or eBay are cluttered and lack features tailored to these types of products.
