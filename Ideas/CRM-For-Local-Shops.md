  ### CRM for Small Indian Businesses

---

### **1. The Problem**
Small Indian businesses often operate in complex ecosystems:
- They need to manage customers, leads, and vendors while complying with local regulations.
- **Pain Points**:

  - Many CRMs lack localized features such as **GST-compliant invoicing**, **support for regional languages**, and simplified workflows tailored to Indian SMBs.
  - Small businesses rely on spreadsheets or manual tracking, which leads to inefficiencies and data loss.
